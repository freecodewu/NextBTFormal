## Inspiration
These problems are what we want to solve.
* Firstly,  most of BT download softwares will disclose your IP address, therefore they can't protect your privacy.
* Secondly , these  softwares will abuse users'  bandwidth, so many users don't want to share their bandwidth. 
* Finally, once the download task is completed,  users will close their BT download software. 
So. Sometimes, some download tasks become very slow.

## What it does
Our vision is building the next generation secure BT download network.
People can share any document and file freely and safely.

## How we built it
We mainly used web3.storage and react to build this application

## Challenges we ran into

* The Feature：We have not implemented the function of downloading by volume through the payment channel

* Market： Let more people use the NextBT.
